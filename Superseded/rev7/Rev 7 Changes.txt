Change to Change Displacement Procedure

When rpm=0 we want high displacement always

If < 1700psi for >2sec, then change to low displacement

If >4000psi AND > 80% of highDispRPM setpoint, then keep in low displacement

If >4000psi AND < 80% of highDispRPM setpoint, then change to high displacement

Motorspeed only calculated in CR0403, stored as global variable and sent to display unit via CAN
